# Pi Packages

Pi packages bundle extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes as local prebuilt packages. A package can declare resources in `package.json` under the `pi` key, or use conventional directories.

## Install and Manage

> **Security:** Pi packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
pi install /absolute/path/to/package
pi install ./relative/path/to/package

pi remove ./relative/path/to/package
pi list                     # show installed packages from settings
pi update                   # no-op for local-only packages
```

By default, `install` and `remove` write to global settings (`~/.pi/agent/settings.json`). Use `-l` to write to project settings (`.pi/settings.json`) instead. Project settings can be shared with your team.

To try a package without installing it, use `--extension` or `-e`. This installs to a temporary directory for the current run only:

```bash
pi -e ./relative/path/to/package
```

## Package Sources

Pi accepts local paths in settings and `pi install`.

```
/absolute/path/to/package
./relative/path/to/package
```

Local paths point to files or directories on disk and are added to settings without copying. Relative paths are resolved against the settings file they appear in. If the path is a file, it loads as a single extension. If it is a directory, pi loads resources using package rules.

## Creating a Pi Package

Add a `pi` manifest to `package.json` or use conventional directories. Include the `pi-package` keyword for discoverability.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Paths are relative to the package root. Arrays support glob patterns and `!exclusions`.

### Gallery Metadata

The [package gallery](https://pi.dev/packages) displays packages tagged with `pi-package`. Add `video` or `image` fields to show a preview:

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "video": "https://example.com/demo.mp4",
    "image": "https://example.com/screenshot.png"
  }
}
```

- **video**: MP4 only. On desktop, autoplays on hover. Clicking opens a fullscreen player.
- **image**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP. Displayed as a static preview.

If both are set, video takes precedence.

## Package Structure

### Convention Directories

If no `pi` manifest is present, pi auto-discovers resources from these directories:

- `extensions/` loads `.ts` and `.js` files
- `skills/` recursively finds `SKILL.md` folders and loads top-level `.md` files as skills
- `prompts/` loads `.md` files
- `themes/` loads `.json` files

## Dependencies

Third party runtime dependencies belong in `dependencies` in `package.json`. Dependencies that do not register extensions, skills, prompt templates, or themes also belong in `dependencies`. Pi does not install dependencies for local packages, so packages must be prebuilt before they are referenced.

Pi bundles core packages for extensions and skills. If you import any of these, list them in `peerDependencies` with a `"*"` range and do not bundle them: `@blastpepsi1-eng/lokai-ai`, `@blastpepsi1-eng/lokai-agent-core`, `@blastpepsi1-eng/lokai-coding-agent`, `@blastpepsi1-eng/lokai-tui`, `typebox`.

Other pi packages must be bundled in your tarball. Add them to `dependencies` and `bundledDependencies`, then reference their resources through `node_modules/` paths. Pi loads packages with separate module roots, so separate installs do not collide or share modules.

Example:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "shitty-extensions": "^1.0.1"
  },
  "bundledDependencies": ["shitty-extensions"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["extensions", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/extensions"],
    "skills": ["skills", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/skills"]
  }
}
```

## Package Filtering

Filter what a package loads using the object form in settings:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "./simple-pkg",
    {
      "source": "./my-package",
      "extensions": ["extensions/*.ts", "!extensions/legacy.ts"],
      "skills": [],
      "prompts": ["prompts/review.md"],
      "themes": ["+themes/legacy.json"]
    }
  ]
}
```

`+path` and `-path` are exact paths relative to the package root.

- Omit a key to load all of that type.
- Use `[]` to load none of that type.
- `!pattern` excludes matches.
- `+path` force-includes an exact path.
- `-path` force-excludes an exact path.
- Filters layer on top of the manifest. They narrow down what is already allowed.

## Enable and Disable Resources

Use `pi config` to enable or disable extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes from installed packages and local directories. Works for both global (`~/.pi/agent`) and project (`.pi/`) scopes.

## Scope and Deduplication

Packages can appear in both global and project settings. If the same package appears in both, the project entry wins. Identity is determined by:

- local: resolved absolute path
